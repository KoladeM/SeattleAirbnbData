# SeattleAirbnbData

This repository consist of the code for the preliminary analysis of the Airbnd dataset. The primary motivation for this is to answer a few questions about the dataset including:
* Is there a correlation between listings with higher ratings and price tag ? We want to know if pricier listings generally have better ratings.
* Are some locations generally more expensive than other locations ?
* Do some locations get better cleanliness ratings ?
* Are expensive locations also the cleanest locations ?

The files in the repository include:
  * ## SeatleData.ipynb 
  This is the primary jupyter notebook for the analysis
  * ## calendar.csv, listings.csv, reviews.csv
  Which are the datasets used for the analysis
  
  ## Summary of Analysis results
  The analysis shows that there is poor correlation between review ratings and prices of listings. It also showed that some zipcodes are generally more expensive than others. The most expensive neighbourhoods are not necessarily the cleanest neighbourhoods.
